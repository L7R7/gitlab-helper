# gitlab-helper

Some utilities for working with GitLab to make your life easier.

## Features

For a full, up to date list of features [see the help text for the program here](test_resources/help-text.txt).

### Working with bulks of merge requests (aka "the million dollar feature" of this tool)

When using tools like Scala Steward or renovate-bot in a setting with many projects with a similar tech stack, you often end up with "the same" merge request for each project when one of the core dependencies is updated.  
Because it's tiresome to do that ("click on _auto-merge_ for the merge request that updates Spring Boot to the latest version, then rebase all the other open merge requests, and after that move on to the next project and repeat), the gitlab-helper will assist you with that.

Let's say you have a bunch of projects that use Spring Boot, and there's a new version released which causes your renovate-bot to open a Merge Request in all your projects.
You could list all of them like that:

```sh
gitlab-helper-exe update-merge-requests --user-id <user-id> --search "Spring Boot" list
```

where `<user-id>` is the User ID of the bot user that your renovate-bot instance is using.
`--search` allows to filter the Merge Requests with a string that appears in the MR's title or the description.

If that looks good, you can merge them:

```sh
gitlab-helper-exe update-merge-requests --user-id <user-id> --search "Spring Boot" merge --execute
```

The `--execute` flag actually makes the tool merge the merge requests. If you omit it, it will do a dry run (in this case, this would only list the MRs it would merge, equivalent to using `list`).
Merging will only be done when the Merge Request branch has a successful pipeline.
If there is no pipeline or the pipeline failed, the MR will stay open (consult the help text of the tool if you're brave and want to merge the merge requests anyway).

If there is a bunch of other MRs open on the project (maybe because there was also an update to npm), you can rebase all of them in one go:

```sh
gitlab-helper-exe update-merge-requests --user-id <user-id> rebase --execute
```

After that, continue with the next bunch of similar MRs.
Or with some other meaningful work.

If you want to see the full list of possibilities, the [help text](test_resources/help-text-mrs.txt) (`gitlab-helper-exe update-merge-requests --help`) is your friend.

## Configuration

The app will look at several places for your configuration, in the following order:

1. command-line arguments
1. environment variables
1. `${PWD}/.gitlab-helper.yml` (the directory in which the executable is started)
1. `~/.gitlab-helper.yml`

If an option is set in multiple sources, the first one wins.
My recommendation is to configure the Base URL and the API Token in the file in your home directory, because they will very likely always be the same.
If you work with different groups, and your working directory is different for each group you work with, you can create a config file that sets the group ID (and possibly excludes) in each of these directories.

For the available command-line options, use `--help` to get the full list.

The available environmnent variables are:

* `HB_BASE_URL`: Base URL of the Gitlab instance you're working with
* `HB_GROUP_ID`: ID of the group you're interested in
* `HB_API_TOKEN`: API Token to use for authorizing requests against the Gitlab API. `api` scope is required.
* `HB_EXCLUDE_PROJECTS`: Lists of projects to exclude

The structure of the configuration files looks like this:

```yaml
config:
  baseUrl: 'https://gitlab.breuni.de'
  apiToken: 'apitoken'
  groupId: 123
  excludeProjects: []
```

### Excluding projects

You can configure a list of IDs of projects that should be excluded from processing.
This does not apply to all possible commands and is not supported in all commands where this might make sense.

There are a couple of interesting details to this option:

* If you don't provide a value in any of the config sources, it defaults to an empty list
* Any configured value overrides other configured values, just like the other options (it might be intuitive to expect the concatenation of all configured lists, but that's not the case). This also means that you can disable all exclusions by configuring an empty list (`""`).

## Running

### Using pre-built binaries

There are pre-built binaries for most of the current platforms as part of the [releases](https://github.com/L7R7/gitlab-helper/releases/latest).
The fastest way to install the tool is downloading it from there.

### Building from Source

If you don't have a working Haskell toolchain on your machine yet, I recommend using [https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) to install a recent version of `stack` (which solves similar problems like `sbt` does for Scala, or Maven for Java).

#### Install

To build the executable and make it available on your path:

```shell script
stack install
```

When you do that for the first time, it will take a while.

### Optional: Configure autocompletion

If you use `zsh`, put this in your `.zshrc` (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61861568/5247502)):

```shell script
gitlab-helper-exe --zsh-completion-script $(which gitlab-helper-exe) > ~/.config/zsh/completions/_gitlab-helper-exe
fpath=($HOME/.config/zsh/completions $fpath)
```

If that doesn't work or if you use `bash`:

```shell script
source <(gitlab-helper-exe --bash-completion-script `which gitlab-helper-exe`)
```

### Run

See what the tool can do for you:

```shell script
gitlab-helper-exe -h
```

The tool will start only if all properties are set in one of the sources.

The repository contains a config file that sets reasonable defaults, see [.gitlab-helper.yaml](.gitlab-helper.yml).
